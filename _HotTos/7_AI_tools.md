# AI Tools

Common tools are ones like LM Studio and Ollama for text based models. Image generation would need something like ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion. That would require a local GPU to work if adding a container. Also, sharing GPUs on same system may create a collision for hardware and cause container crashes. It is best to try and distribute your GPU resources and select for certain use cases.

Easier start point for LLM can be the following:

- LM Studio for PC
- Ollama can be install on PC and Mac / Linux
